##About

Browsing [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/2cv59l/blastjs_blast_text_apart_to_make_it_manipulable/) this morning introduced me to [Blast.JS](http://julian.com/research/blast/) -- a handy jQuery plugin that permits easy typographic manipulation. I wanted to play with it a little bit so I threw this together. 

##What does it do?

1. Pull recent headlines from r/all
2. Display in stylized and cool format

[Demo can be viewed here](http://reddit.eran.sh/)

##Made possible by...
- [Blast.JS](http://julian.com/research/blast/)
- [slabText](http://freqdec.github.io/slabText/)
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)

##Confession

This is really sloppy. Sorry.
